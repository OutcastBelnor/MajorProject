# Procedurally Populated Environment With Use of Steering Behaviours

  This is my Major Project for the Bachelor's degree, which I did at Aberystwyth University. 
  
  The project was my adaptation of the ['AI Director'](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2009/ai_systems_of_l4d_mike_booth.pdf) from a quite popular game 'Left 4 Dead' by Valve. I also used [steering behaviours algorithms](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/), which were first defined by Craig Reynolds  for automating the Enemy entities in the scene.
  
  The game is still pretty much in the raw stage, the AI systems are there but there are no goals yet, no menu or the end screen. This is something I want to work on once I'll have time for it. For now try it out and I hope you will enjoy it!
